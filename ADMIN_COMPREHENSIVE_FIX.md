# Admin Panel Comprehensive Check & Fixes

## Status: All Features Check (November 24, 2025)

### 🔧 Issues Fixed:

#### 1. **Events Table - NULL ID Issue** ✅
**Problem**: Events created successfully but returned with `id: null` and `created_at: null`
**Root Cause**: Database not returning generated columns or RLS blocking SELECT
**Solution**:
- Changed `.select()` to `.select('*')` in POST endpoint
- Removed overly strict filters that removed all events
- Added service role policy to events table
- SQL script created: `fix_events_table.sql`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/admin/events/route.ts` - GET and POST endpoints use `select('*')`
- `app/api/events/route.ts` - Public API uses `select('*')`
- `app/admin/events/page.tsx` - Removed filter, added optimistic update
- `app/admin/gallery/page.tsx` - Relaxed event filtering
- `app/info/page.tsx` - Removed strict filters

#### 2. **Image Cropper Premature Submit** ✅
**Problem**: Form submitted when clicking "Terapkan" in image cropper
**Solution**: Added `type="button"` to all buttons in ImageCropper
**Files Modified**:
- `components/ImageCropper.tsx`

#### 3. **Duplicate Key Warnings** ✅
**Problem**: React warning about duplicate `null` keys
**Solution**: Use fallback keys (title, slug, index) when id is missing
**Files Modified**:
- `app/admin/events/page.tsx`
- `app/info/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/gallery/page.tsx`

#### 4. **User Approval Not Working** ✅
**Problem**: Approved users still showed as pending and couldn't login
**Solution**:
- Set `email_verified = true` when approving
- Added optimistic UI update
- Enhanced logging
**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/admin/users/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/admin/users/page.tsx`

### 🚀 Next Steps for User:

1. **Run SQL Script**: Execute `fix_events_table.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Test Event Creation**: Create a new event and verify it appears in both admin panel and public page
3. **Test User Approval**: Approve a pending user and verify they can login
4. **Test Gallery**: Create gallery item and associate with event
5. **Monitor Console**: Check browser console for any remaining errors

### 📝 Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Approved user can login successfully

### 🔍 Debug Commands:

SELECT id, title, event_date, created_at FROM events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check users approval status
SELECT id, email, approved, email_verified, rejected FROM users WHERE approved = true LIMIT 10;

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename IN ('events', 'users', 'gallery');
```

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check terminal for API errors
